        <h1>Welcome to the RVK HEMA Running Club Tournaments (RCT's)</h1>
        <p>The tournament is in Longsword (LRCT), Saber (SRCT) and Rapier (RRCT).</p>
        <p>Use the navigation bar to view each tournament.</p>

        <h4>General tournament rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>There are three separate tournaments in Longsword, Saber and Rapier.</li>
            <li>The tournaments start 1st of September and end on August 31 next year.</li>
            <li>The tournaments are ranked based, ranks are randomised at the start of the tournament.</li>
            <li>To advance in rank you issue a challenge to anyone in the three spots above you in the ranking. So if you are ranked 5th you can challenge 2nd, 3rd or 4th place.</li>
            <li>If you win the match you take the rank of the one you challenged and everyone between you and them drops down one place. In the above example the 2nd place drops to 3rd, 3rd to 4th, 4th to 5th and the 5th jumps to 2nd place given the 5th place challenges the 2nd place.</li>
            <li>If none of the people you can challange have shown up for two weeks you can challange one spot up, so the next 4 above you.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This increases by one for every additional week.</li>
                <li>The inrease does not happen if a challengable person was present but not challenged.</li>
                <li>You need to show up to the majority of practices within the weeks for this rule to apply.</li>
                <li>If it's for the top 3 in the weapon then participants might assume the next spot above them at management's descression.</li>
                <li>Ranks might also be changed at management's descresion in general for this rule.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If you lose a challenge you placed nothing happens.</li>
            <li>Challange times are at the discretion of coache. The tournament should not interfere with normal practice.</li>
            <li>You may issue one challenge in each tournament per week.</li>
            <li>You can be challenged multiple times in a week.</li>
            <li>If you where challanged and lost and still have not challanged anyone within the week you may not challange the one that just defeated you until next week.</li>
            <li>Challange reset day is Monday. This means you can challange in a weapon on Friday and then again on Monday.</li>
            <li>You can generally not refuse a challenge, there are “common sense” exemptions to this rule.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You've already been challanged that practice.</li>
                <li>You had a really bad day at work.</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Challenges are full 3 min matches with a table, judge and two referees.</li>
            <li>All participants are automatically in the pool of judges and refs.</li>
            <li>Table is responsible for registering the match results.</li>
            <li>You can not refuse to ref or judge. Refusal can result in a reduction in rank.</li>
            <li>Keppinautur rules apply for all weapons.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rúnar is in charge of Longsword scoring.</li>
                <li>Hákon is in charge of Saber scoring.</li>
                <li>Freyja is in charge of Rapier scoring.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
